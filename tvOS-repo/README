Howdy, Y'all I'm a level 1 dev trying to get my foot in the door. As a heads up. 

this repo was built based off:
https://github.com/Aatoz/Sileo
thanks @Aartoz for making the theme kit.

And My kodi fork was built based on:
https://github.com/fuzzard/xbmc/blob/master_darwin-embedded-ATV/

All i did so far was compile a deb file from that source in hopes i can help port it up for APPLETV. 
Sorry if i'm bad at Sourcing. like i said level 1. 
<3 

hope i can make better stuff as i learn not just porting stuff.
